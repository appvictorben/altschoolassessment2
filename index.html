        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Victor Ome Umukoro. I am a website designer, blogger, hardware engineer, and cricket coach.</p><br/>
        <p>I have always been fascinated by computers — understanding how and why things work has been my constant curiosity. This passion drives me to keep exploring the world of information and communication technology (ICT).</p><br/>
        <p>When I’m away from my computer, you’ll often find me on the cricket pitch, either coaching or playing the game I love.</p>
